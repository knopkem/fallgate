## Source code

We made the original TypeScript source code available for educational purposes in the `src/` directory. (See [#1](https://github.com/mbforbes/fallgate/issues/1))

Right now, we don't have a license in this repository, which means default copyright laws apply (i.e., we retrain all rights to the code and assets and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from our work). However, if you'd like to use part of the source code for another project, open an issue and let's chat.
